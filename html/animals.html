            <h3>Larry The Lion</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Say hello to Larry, our majestic African lion with a story as powerful as his roar! Larry was rescued from the clutches of poachers in South Africa, where his life took a terrifying turn. Once a proud ruler of the savannah, Larry was captured illegally and destined for the wildlife trade.
            </p>
            <p>    
              Thankfully, Larry’s story didn’t end there. Wildlife conservationists stepped in just in time, saving him from a tragic fate. After a long journey of recovery, Larry found a safe and loving home with us, where he now thrives as an ambassador for his species.
            </p>
            <p>  
              Here at [Zoo Name], Larry enjoys a life of comfort and care in a spacious, naturalistic habitat designed just for him. He loves basking in the sun, sharpening his claws on tree trunks, and letting out the occasional thunderous roar to remind us all why lions are called kings of the jungle.
            </p>
            <p>  
              When you visit Larry, you’re not just meeting a magnificent animal—you’re witnessing the triumph of hope and resilience. Come say hi to Larry and learn more about how you can help protect lions in the wild! 🦁
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>Lions are lazy... sometimes!</i>
              While they’re known for their strength, lions actually sleep between 16-20 hours a day! They’re basically the big, fluffy cats of the savannah.
            </p>

          <div class="grid-item" id="Johnny-The-Jackal">
            <img src="../assets/Animals/Jackal.jpg" class="animal-image" alt="jackal" />
            <h3>Johnny The Jackal</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Introducing Johnny, our sharp-witted side-striped jackal with a tale as remarkable as his keen senses! Johnny’s journey to [Zoo Name] is one of resilience and second chances. Found injured near a bustling South African village, Johnny had been caught in a conflict between wildlife and humans—his natural habitat was shrinking, and he was struggling to survive.
            </p>
            <p>    
              A group of dedicated wildlife rescuers stepped in to help, nursing Johnny back to health after a leg injury left him unable to fend for himself. Though returning to the wild was no longer an option, Johnny has found a new purpose here with us, inspiring visitors to learn about the challenges animals like him face in the wild.
            </p>
            <p>  
              In his habitat, Johnny shows off his playful yet cautious nature. He enjoys exploring enrichment activities, foraging for treats, and occasionally surprising us with his famous jackal howl. His sharp eyes and alert ears make him one of the most fascinating animals to observe!
            </p>
            <p>  
              Johnny’s story is a reminder of how human-wildlife coexistence can work when compassion leads the way. Stop by and meet Johnny to hear more about his journey and how we’re working to protect jackals and other wildlife. 🐺
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>The Sneaky Snack!</i>
              Jackals are excellent scavengers. Johnny probably thinks he’s being sneaky when he grabs a snack, but he’s actually super skilled at finding food, even in the most unexpected places.

            <h3>Rosie The Rhino</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Say hello to Rosie, our resilient southern white rhinoceros with a story as strong as her horn! Rosie was rescued from a dangerous poaching incident in South Africa, where she narrowly escaped losing her horn to illegal wildlife traffickers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brought to safety by a team of conservationists, Rosie received the care she needed to recover from her injuries. Although the scars of her past remain, her spirit is as strong as ever. Now, she thrives in her habitat at [Zoo Name], where she roams peacefully, enjoying mud wallows and hearty meals of fresh grass and hay.
            </p>
            <p>  
              Rosie is an ambassador for rhino conservation, reminding us all of the importance of protecting these gentle giants. Come meet Rosie and learn how you can help ensure a future where rhinos roam free. 🦏  
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>Horn of Plenty!</i>
              Rosie’s horn is made of keratin (the same stuff as your hair and nails!). So, in a way, Rosie’s just rocking a super stylish, nature-made hairdo.
            </p>

          <div class="grid-item" id="Ellie-The-Elephant">
            <img src="../assets/Animals/Elephant.jpg" class="animal-image" alt="elephant" />
            <h3>Ellie THe Elephant</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Get to know Ellie, our wise and wonderful African elephant! Ellie was rescued as a calf after her herd fell victim to human-wildlife conflict in South Africa. Alone and vulnerable, Ellie was found by conservationists who brought her to safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since arriving at [Zoo Name], Ellie has blossomed into a playful and curious elephant who loves splashing in her pool, exploring her habitat, and showing off her impressive trunk skills. Her story is a reminder of how crucial it is to protect the habitats elephants need to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>  
              Ellie’s charisma and charm make her a favorite among visitors of all ages. Stop by and watch her in action—she might even wave her trunk to say hello! 🐘  
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>Ear-Resistible!</i>
              Ellie’s ears are huge, and not just for hearing. They help keep her cool by releasing heat! It’s like she’s got built-in fans on either side of her head.

          <div class="grid-item" id="Gerald-The-Giraffe">
            <img src="../assets/Animals/Giraffe.jpg" class="animal-image" alt="giraffe" />
            <h3>Gerald The Giraffe</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Say hi to Gerald, our towering giraffe with an equally impressive story! Gerald was rescued as a calf when drought conditions in South Africa left his family struggling to find food. Underweight and dehydrated, Gerald was taken in by wildlife experts who nursed him back to health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now at [Zoo Name], Gerald enjoys a life full of leafy treats and plenty of space to stretch his long legs and neck. He’s known for his curiosity, often inspecting visitors with his big, gentle eyes and playful demeanor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gerald’s story is a testament to the importance of conservation efforts during times of environmental hardship. Visit Gerald and discover the fascinating world of giraffes—don’t forget to look up! 🦒
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>Food for Thought!</i>
              Gerald can eat up to 75 pounds of leaves a day, but he’s picky about his meals. Only the tastiest leaves from the highest trees will do!
            </p>

          <div class="grid-item" id="Zach-The-Zebra">
            <img src="../assets/Animals/Zebra.jpg" class="animal-image" alt="Zebra" />
            <h3>Zach The Zebra</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Zach the Zebra stands out with his striking black-and-white stripes, but did you know no two zebras have the same pattern? Rescued from a reserve where habitat loss threatened his safety, Zach is now thriving in our care.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zach’s stripes aren’t just for show—they act as a natural camouflage in the wild, confusing predators by breaking up his silhouette. But at the zoo, Zach enjoys showing off his patterns to visitors, often coming right up to the fence for a closer look.
            </p>
            <p>
              He’s also a social butterfly, forming strong bonds with the other animals in his enclosure. Whether he’s munching on hay or trotting around with friends, Zach is full of energy and charm. Stop by to meet Zach and see if you can spot the unique swirl on his shoulder—it’s his one-of-a-kind "zebra fingerprint"! 🦓
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>A Stripe A Day Keeps The Sun Away!</i>
              Zach’s stripes might look simple, but they help regulate his body temperature in the hot sun.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item" id="Isaac-The-Impala">
            <img src="../assets/Animals/Impala.jpg" class="animal-image" alt="impala" />
            <h3>Isaac The Impala</h3>
            <p>
              <b>Introduction:</b> Graceful and swift, Isaac the Impala is one of the newest members of our [Zoo Name] family. Rescued from a drought-stricken region, Isaac found sanctuary where he could leap and bound to his heart’s content. Known for his athletic prowess, Isaac can leap over obstacles nearly three times his height with ease.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the wild, Isaac would rely on his agility to evade predators, but here at the zoo, he enjoys a much more leisurely pace. You'll often find him grazing peacefully or playfully racing his fellow impalas around the enclosure. Isaac is not just about speed—he’s also known for his curious personality, often approaching zookeepers with wide, wondering eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next time you visit, be sure to watch Isaac in action. Whether he's jumping or just relaxing, he’ll surely inspire awe and admiration. 🦌
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Fun Fact: </b> <i>Yummy Yummy!</i>
              They are known as one of nature’s “fast food” because they’re a preferred meal for many predators—but not Isaac here!
