            <p1>
              Say hello to Larry, our majestic African lion with a story as powerful as his roar! Larry was rescued from the clutches of poachers in South Africa, where his life took a terrifying turn. Once a proud ruler of the savannah, Larry was captured illegally and destined for the wildlife trade.

              Thankfully, Larry’s story didn’t end there. Wildlife conservationists stepped in just in time, saving him from a tragic fate. After a long journey of recovery, Larry found a safe and loving home with us, where he now thrives as an ambassador for his species.
              
              Here at [Zoo Name], Larry enjoys a life of comfort and care in a spacious, naturalistic habitat designed just for him. He loves basking in the sun, sharpening his claws on tree trunks, and letting out the occasional thunderous roar to remind us all why lions are called kings of the jungle.
              
              When you visit Larry, you’re not just meeting a magnificent animal—you’re witnessing the triumph of hope and resilience. Come say hi to Larry and learn more about how you can help protect lions in the wild! 🦁
